# National Robotics Competition Project


## Project Overview

Our project involves the design and development of a modular robot that can be controlled autonomously or by a custom-built controller. The robot is designed to navigate through various obstacles and challenges as part of the competition. The key components of this project include:

- **Autonomous Mode:** The robot can operate independently using pre-programmed instructions and sensor inputs to navigate and perform tasks.
- **Pilot Mode:** The robot can be controlled using a custom-made controller, allowing for manual navigation and task execution.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **3D Model Files:** Contains STL and GCODE files for the 3D-printed components of the robot, including motor mounts and ultrasonic sensor mounts.
- **NRC_Autonomous:** Includes all the code related to the autonomous functionality of the robot, such as sensor initialization and movement control.
- **NRC_Pilot:** Contains the code for the pilot-controlled mode, along with a custom controller and a BLE demo.
- **Pictures and Videos:** A collection of images and videos showcasing different stages of the project, including 3D printing, soldering, and robot testing.
